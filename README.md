# hello-world
Just starting out. Hello! 

I'm excited to begin making useful things :) I recently took the Codecademy Python course, and I'm totally hooked on the feeling.

Subjects I'm prepared to offer help/advice on: 
   - Excel VBA macros
   - Business Objects/webi data reporting
   - Can point you to excellent diversity in tech resources

Subjects I'm hoping to connect with others to learn:
   - Going from knowing how to write specific functions to knowing which approach is best for the situation
   - How to get started contributing to existing projects

See you around! -Sonia
